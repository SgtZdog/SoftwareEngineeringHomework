A retailer selling my personal information to others for profit is a bit of a weird situation. It very much makes me think of privacy vs right to record. As a society we're very torn on this issue with laws varying by state. If we think of the transaction from which the retailer got this info as a conversation, suddenly this looks more like a question of does the retailer have the right to record the conversation. And it should be noted that it's generally accepted that they have the right to record at least some of the 'conversation' for their own bookeeping. If we establish that they have the right to record the conversation (legal in many states), then can we infer they have the right to do with that recording what they want? That seems reasonable enough. It's well established that there is no right to privacy from recordings others have made of you in this way. And there are other retailers who serve the market by providing more discretion demonstrating that we as purchasers do have options. And if we want to maintain capitalism and business as entities with rights then we must accept that they will attempt to make money off of their recorded 'conversations'.
It should be acknowledged however, the scale of this capability to sell these recorded conversations has outpaced the market's ability to adapt. While some vendors do provide more discretion (and others are forced to by laws such as HIPAA), in many cases there aren't viable alternatives. Grocery stores are an excellent example of this, where there are few if any available alternatives that don't sell the customers information while at the same time being one of the largest sources of this information today.
